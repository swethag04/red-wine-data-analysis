## Exploratory Data Analysis of Red wine dataset using R

The objective of this Exploratory data analysis of the Red wine dataset is to analyze the variables and determine which of the chemical properties of the wine influence its quality the most.

The red wine dataset contains observations of 1,599 red wines with 11 variables on the chemical properties of the wine. Atleast 3 wines experts rated the quality of each wine, providing a rating between 0 (very bad) and 10 (very good).

The variables in the dataset are as below.

### Input variables (based on physicochemical tests):

  1. fixed acidity (tartaric acid - g / dm^3)
  2. volatile acidity (acetic acid - g / dm^3)
  3. citric acid (g / dm^3)
  4. residual sugar (g / dm^3)
  5. chlorides (sodium chloride - g / dm^3
  6. free sulfur dioxide (mg / dm^3)
  7. total sulfur dioxide (mg / dm^3)
  8. density (g / cm^3)
  9. pH
  10. sulphates (potassium sulphate - g / dm3)
  11. alcohol (% by volume)

### Output variable (based on sensory data):
  12. quality (score between 0 and 10)
